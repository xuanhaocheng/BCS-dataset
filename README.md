BCS-dataset
=====

*At present, the BCS dataset has more than 60 categories and nearly 240000 images. This dataset will be updated at regular intervals. If users have any suggestions about this dataset, please contact me via email. My email is a1163478254@163.com 。 For example, you want me to help you collect pictures of architectural styles in different countries, or pictures of transport vehicles on construction sites in different countries, or you want to tell me some subclasses of civil engineering that are not available in this dataset, or you want to share photos of civil engineering that are difficult to collect online with our dataset.*

The purpose of this dataset is to collect a large amount of civil engineering data through open source, crawler and on-site collection, and hope to become a super large public dataset of civil engineering in the future. Scholars can carry out classification model research on this dataset, etc..


*Crawler*
=====

![web crawler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124375093/217705532-c0c19fe5-d9d8-4ed8-ba7b-0a9fbbddd46b.jpg)

Users can use crawler to crawl the information they want from the Internet according to their own needs, so as to build their own datasets.
